# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Intelligent Document Processing (IDP) application provides a streamlined solution for processing documents through OCR, classification, and summarization. Users can upload documents via a simple web interface, and the system automatically processes them through a three-stage pipeline, storing results in a flexible database and displaying outcomes in the user interface.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Document Upload Interface
**User Story:** As a user, I want to upload documents through a simple web interface, so that I can process them through the IDP pipeline.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a user accesses the web application THE SYSTEM SHALL display a clean, professional upload interface
2. WHEN a user selects a document file THE SYSTEM SHALL validate the file type and size
3. WHEN a user uploads a document THE SYSTEM SHALL store it in AWS S3 and trigger the processing pipeline
4. WHEN a document upload is successful THE SYSTEM SHALL display a confirmation message with tracking information

### Requirement 2: OCR Processing
**User Story:** As a system, I want to extract text content from uploaded documents as key-value pairs, so that structured data can be obtained for further processing.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a document is uploaded THE SYSTEM SHALL trigger OCR processing automatically
2. WHEN OCR processing begins THE SYSTEM SHALL extract text content from the document
3. WHEN OCR extraction is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL format results as key-value pairs in JSON format
4. WHEN JSON contains markdown-wrapped content THE SYSTEM SHALL handle it correctly
5. WHEN OCR processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL store results in the database

### Requirement 3: Document Classification
**User Story:** As a system, I want to classify documents into predefined categories, so that documents can be organized and processed appropriately.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN OCR processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL begin document classification
2. WHEN classification begins THE SYSTEM SHALL analyze document content against available categories
3. WHEN classification is performed THE SYSTEM SHALL use these categories: Dietary Supplement, Stationery, Kitchen Supplies, Medicine, Other
4. WHEN classification is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL assign the most appropriate category
5. WHEN classification is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL store results in the database

### Requirement 4: Document Summarization
**User Story:** As a system, I want to generate summaries of processed documents, so that users can quickly understand document content.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN document classification is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL begin summarization
2. WHEN summarization begins THE SYSTEM SHALL analyze the extracted text content
3. WHEN summarization is performed THE SYSTEM SHALL generate a concise summary
4. WHEN summarization is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL store results in the database

### Requirement 5: Results Display
**User Story:** As a user, I want to view the processing results in the web interface, so that I can see OCR output, classification, and summary.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN all processing tasks are complete THE SYSTEM SHALL display results in the user interface
2. WHEN results are displayed THE SYSTEM SHALL show OCR key-value pairs in a readable format
3. WHEN results are displayed THE SYSTEM SHALL show the assigned document category
4. WHEN results are displayed THE SYSTEM SHALL show the generated summary
5. WHEN results are displayed THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain a professional, clean interface

### Requirement 6: Data Storage
**User Story:** As a system, I want to store processing results in a flexible database, so that data can be retrieved and displayed efficiently.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN processing results are generated THE SYSTEM SHALL store them in DynamoDB
2. WHEN storing data THE SYSTEM SHALL use a flexible schema to accommodate varying document types
3. WHEN storing data THE SYSTEM SHALL maintain relationships between upload, OCR, classification, and summarization results
4. WHEN data is stored THE SYSTEM SHALL enable efficient retrieval for display purposes

### Requirement 7: End-to-End Processing
**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to process documents automatically from upload to results display, so that I have a seamless experience.

**Acceptance Criteria:**
1. WHEN a document is uploaded THE SYSTEM SHALL process it through all three stages sequentially
2. WHEN processing is in progress THE SYSTEM SHALL provide status updates
3. WHEN processing encounters errors THE SYSTEM SHALL handle them gracefully and notify the user
4. WHEN processing is complete THE SYSTEM SHALL automatically display results without user intervention
